            Pigeons are often called the 'rats of the sky', but before we
            dismiss them entirely, let's take a closer look at these
            misunderstood birds. Despite their negative reputation, pigeons are
            fascinating creatures with a rich history of coexisting with humans
            in cities around the world.
